# Stock Market Dynamics for Enterprise Tasks
## Overview
Confidoo is a product of our strategic partner in Switzerland: K-at-R Consulting. It is a product with a unique concept for creating a platform for corporate productivity. Its goal is to create the dynamics of a stock exchange in the context of project tasks and outcomes and create more participation, interest in company staff and more information for project leaders. The overall result of their platform is high organizational responsiveness.
## Business Problem
Cofidoo wanted to create a platform that is closely integrated with standard collaboration tools in the market. The idea was to leverage the user base and ease of use of these tools and to fit Confidoo’s app with workflows of the enterprises. This meant that the platform needed to be built with configurability and adaptability in mind so that it can be integrated with a wide range of collaboration tools like MS Teams, Atlassian Confluence, etc. Confidoo needed a proof of concept application fast to demonstrate their concept to early adopters and potential investors. Once the prototype was built they needed to roll out the live fully working version in a short time to stay within budget. At the same time they needed considerable flexibility in the platform’s architecture so that it can be easily changed based on early feedback and change in collaboration platforms.
## Our Solution
Given the short timeline of the initial deliveries we focused first on wireframing the concept to reach a quick specification. We used this as our guide to build the proof of concept application which tackled various technology questions such as integration with collaboration platforms, etc. We focused on building for the MS Teams platform as our first live application based on business analysis. 

We used Microsoft .NET core based web application built as an MS Azure app. We leveraged Azure WebJobs and Azure SQL database to speed up our development and save time on deployments and configurations. We used Angular.js for front end and SignalR for real time behaviours. We built an adaptation layer for MS Teams using the teams API.
## Impact
We developed the proof of concept application in record time giving the product a huge advantage in getting initial interest from early adopters and investors. With this prototype application the owners could work in developing interest while we developed the full version of the app for MS Teams. This fast roll out meant early traction which lead to interest from Microsoft Switzerland itself to adapt this tool in their workflow. Having Microsoft involved meant we had huge support in building the product out for MS Teams. They supported us with the integration with their tools and ran the initial feedback cycles themselves from their teams. The end result is a great first product that is now available on MS Teams appstore and has already had some major adoption apart from MS Switzerland. Confidoo is planning to extend their product and integrate in other platforms as the user base grows. We ourselves at Penaxis have been using the product - dog fooding is always the best way to improve a software and we are happy that we can help our client with this.
