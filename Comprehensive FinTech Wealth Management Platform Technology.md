# Comprehensive FinTech Wealth Management Platform Technology
## Overview
The client emphasized the critical importance of wealth accumulation and securing the financial future of one's family and loved ones as top priorities in life. They also stressed the significance of ensuring that this accumulated wealth ultimately benefits their family. Globally, billions of dollars in unclaimed funds from insurance, bank deposits, and other investments remain untouched. A primary reason for this is that beneficiaries or immediate family members are often unaware of these assets.

In response to this challenge, the client developed practical strategies for responsible family wealth management. They established an accessible and secure web-based platform that allows customers to create and maintain a comprehensive repository of their important financial information. This innovative solution enables individuals to safeguard their hard-earned wealth and provide financial security to their heirs when needed, all through an affordable and user-friendly interface.
## Business Problem
The challenges encountered during the development of a wealth management website for the client:
- The idea was for a user to register on the site and then they should be able to add their wealth-related data with relevant documents. Since the information was sensitive, security was a concern.
- Another idea that sprung up after the users were able to add their data was to enable them to share it with multiple people including their family members, friends and/or financial advisors.
## Our Solution
This wealth management website leverages advanced technology to provide a comprehensive and feature-packed solution.:

- In order to take care of the security part, we used a combination of AES (symmetric) and RSA (asymmetric) algorithms for encryption. The idea was to generate RSA public and private keys at the backend. Share the RSA public key to the front end. Encrypt the documents and data with the AES key and then encrypt the AES key with the RSA public key and send the data to the backend for storage.

- With the idea of sharing enabled, we came up with a common interface for inter-sharing which would connect different entities where:

**a.** A user will be able to share their data with their family members or friends.

**b.** A user will be able to view data shared with them.

**c.** A user will be able to share the data that was shared with them.

**d.** If a user is a financial advisor, they will be able to maintain data for their clients and share with them from a single data source. 

- **Simple and easy interface**

While not everyone is adept with technology, and even if someone is, the website we designed is aimed at keeping things simple and easy for anyone to use and manage their data efficiently.
- **Safely share wealth data with family, friends or financial advisors**

Wealth Management Website allows users to add unlimited family members and share their investment information with them. Family members, on the other hand, will be able to login for free and view all the investment data that was shared with them.
- **Realtime anywhere access**

Since all the user investment data is securely stored on the cloud, they will be able to retrieve their financial information when they need it the most and in real time.
- **Adept security Implementation**

The platform uses reliable encryption techniques and efficient security measures to safeguard data so that users need not worry about losing their sensitive financial information.
## Impact
The execution of the wealth management website produced several noteworthy outcomes:
- A robust and secure solution to maintain your sensitive data in one place.

- An intuitive Dashboard that gives the users high-level information they need to know about their data.

- Ability to share and maintain the data with family members, friends, and/or financial advisors.

- The ability for users like financial advisors to maintain their client data in one place and make it available to them. In turn, the clients are able to share this data with their loved ones.
