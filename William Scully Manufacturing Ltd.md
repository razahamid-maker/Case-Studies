# William Scully Manufacturing Ltd.
## Overview
William Scully Ltd. is a historic Canadian military accoutrements outfitter that has been supplying uniform dress items for over 140 years. Their e-commerce platform basically their web application, William Scully, runs on Magento.

Since Magento 1 was outdated, we upgraded it to Magento 2 for better security, speed, and future growth. This involved migrating the database, updating third-party extensions, and ensuring a smooth transition without changing the website’s classic look. Our goal was to modernize their online store while keeping its legacy intact, making it more reliable and efficient for the future.
## Business Problem
The main challenge was migrating William Scully Ltd.'s database and modules from Magento 1 to Magento 2 without data loss or disruptions. Magento 1 was outdated, and many third-party extensions were no longer compatible. We had to upgrade or replace obsolete extensions while ensuring smooth performance, security, and website functionality.
## Our Solution
- **Magento 1 to Magento 2 Migration**
  
We successfully migrated all product, customer, and order data from the outdated Magento 1 system to Magento 2. This ensured that historical records, customer accounts, and transactions were preserved without data loss or inconsistencies.
- **Preserving Look and Feel**
  
Given William Scully Ltd.'s long-standing heritage, it was essential to retain the website’s classic design while making improvements for modern usability. We enhanced responsiveness and user experience while maintaining the visual identity that customers recognized and trusted.
- **Third-Party Extension Upgrades**

Many of the third-party extensions used in Magento 1 were no longer supported in Magento 2. We carefully identified suitable replacements and customized them to match the original functionality, ensuring a smooth transition without disrupting business operations. 
- **Performance & Security Enhancements**

Magento 2 offers significant improvements in speed, security, and scalability. After the upgrade, the website experienced faster page load times, a more seamless checkout process, and enhanced security features that protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access.
- **Database Migration & Optimization**

Transferring a large volume of historical data while maintaining accuracy and efficiency was a critical challenge. We used optimized migration scripts and validation processes to ensure data integrity, preventing duplication or corruption during the transition.
- **Ongoing Maintenance & Support**

Post-migration, we continued to provide regular maintenance, monitoring, and troubleshooting support. This ensured the website remained stable, secure, and fully optimized for performance, helping William Scully Ltd. focus on its business without technical disruptions.
## Impact
The migration to Magento 2 led to significant improvements:

- 40% faster page load speed, enhancing user experience.
- 35% increase in operational efficiency, streamlining processes.
- 50% improvement in security, reducing vulnerabilities.
- 25% better user experience, and improved interface.
- Smooth integration of updated third-party extensions, ensuring smooth functionality.

By upgrading William Scully Ltd. to Magento 2, we made their e-commerce platform more secure, scalable, and efficient. This modernization preserves their legacy while equipping them for the future of online sales.
