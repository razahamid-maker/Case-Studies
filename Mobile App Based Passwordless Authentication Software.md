- **Integration of MFA and SSO**

MFA and SSO capabilities had to be easily integrated with our applications to provide stronger protection without compromising flexibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface**

Designing a user-friendly app that could securely encrypt and store sensitive information posed a challenge in balancing functionality and ease of use.

- **Compliance with Security Standards**

The client also had various constraints that had to be met within the app, such as security standards of the industry, which had to followed, and the app had to remain scalable and easy to manage at the same time.
## Our Solution
- **Zero Knowledge Architecture**

We launched a Passwordless password manager through which all the user data will remain encrypted to provide optimum privacy and security.

- **Biometric Authentication**

We integrated Biometric access to the application, such as replacing passwords with fingerprint or face recognition, which will increase both security and convenience.

The great enhancements that we put in the protection layer ensured that users' data remained safe, thus minimizing incidences of leakage.

- **Improved User Experience**

Instead of having to remember or type in a password, biometric authentication reduced the steps through which users had to go. The running of the apps became easy and faster when they introduced this so they were happier with the app.
