# FinTech Web App for Interest-Free School Fee EMI
## Overview
The client initiated a project aimed at transforming financial accessibility and streamlining payment processes for parents and educational institutions. The objective was to tackle the challenges encountered by both parties in managing tuition fees and financial transactions efficiently.
## Business Problem
The existing system posed challenges for parents, who struggled with lump-sum payments and financial stress, while education institutes faced difficulties in managing cash flow and administrative burdens associated with financial transactions.
- In this industry, operational procedures often rely on manual processes, presenting inefficiencies that hinder seamless transactions.
- The absence of online loan facilities further compounds the challenges faced by stakeholders in accessing financial support within this sector.
- There is a pressing need to streamline operations and introduce automation to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
- Despite the growing demand for online financial services, the school fee payment sector lags in providing convenient digital solutions.
- Addressing these shortcomings presents an opportunity for innovation and the introduction of transformative technologies to modernize the industry.
## Our Solution
We employed the following technologies to develop the fintech web application
- Database: MySQL provides reliable, scalable database management for secure data storage and retrieval.
- API/ Communication Protocol: REST API enables seamless data exchange between the frontend and the backend.
- Frontend Framework: Next.js powers frontend with server-side rendering for optimized performance.
- Backend Framework: Laravel drives backend operations efficiently with robust MVC architecture.

Additionally, the SignDesk JavaScript widget is utilized to seamlessly integrate eSign capabilities within the application. Furthermore, MSG91API integration enables the platform to send SMS notifications and reminders, ensuring effective and timely communication with users.
